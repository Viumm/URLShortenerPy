# URLShortenerPy
A simple Python script to shorten URLs using the ShortURL.at service. It uses requests and BeautifulSoup to handle web requests and parse HTML responses.

This script is based on the original work by [hastagAB](https://github.com/hastagAB/Awesome-Python-Scripts/blob/master/url_shortener/url_shortener.py).
